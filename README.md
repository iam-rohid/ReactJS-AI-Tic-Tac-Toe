<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="center"><img src="./images/game-image-1.png" width="400px"><p>

It's a Tic Tac Toe Game but here you have to play with the AI instead of human ;-)
And for that there's only 5% of chances that you can win this game ðŸ™‚. If you think you are on of the 5% of people then give it a try ðŸ˜œ.

### Built With
Because this is a web based game that's why I choose react framework for the UI but you can make it with just simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
